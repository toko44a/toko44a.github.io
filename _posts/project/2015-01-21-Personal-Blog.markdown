####Personal Blog
The Client ask us to design an elegant personal blog. They asked to build a simple minimalist theme, but at the same time is eye catching. So we proposed several themes, one with fixed navigation sidebar and one with themes that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. Take his time for a while, he chose the fixed sidebar on the left.
